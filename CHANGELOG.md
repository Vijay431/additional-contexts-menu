# Changelog

All notable changes to the "Additional Context Menus" extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0]

### Added

- **📋 Copy File Contents**: New `additionalContextMenus.copyFileContents` command — right-click any single file in the Explorer to copy its entire contents to the clipboard without opening it. Appears in `explorer/context` under the "Copy Path" group; restricted to single non-folder files via `!explorerResourceIsFolder && !listMultiSelection` when-clause.
- **📁 Duplicate File**: New `additionalContextMenus.duplicateFile` command — right-click any single file in the Explorer to create a duplicate alongside the original. The duplicate is named `<basename>-duplicate<ext>`; if that name already exists, it auto-increments (`<basename>-duplicate-1<ext>`, `-2`, …). Appears in the Explorer `7_modification` group; restricted to single non-folder files via `!explorerResourceIsFolder && !listMultiSelection`.
- **🧪 Test suite**: Two-layer test infrastructure — Vitest unit tests for infrastructure utilities/services (`Cache`, `pathValidator`, `ConfigValidator`, `accessibilityHelper`, `CodeAnalysisService`, `ProjectDetectionService`, `FileDiscoveryService`) and Mocha + `@vscode/test-electron` integration tests for all 13 user-facing features end-to-end.
- **CI test jobs**: `test-unit` and `test-integration` jobs run in parallel after `lint` and must pass before `build` in the CI pipeline.
- **Coverage reporting**: Added `pnpm run test:unit:coverage` and Codecov upload support through CI.
- **Community standards**: Added structured YAML bug and feature issue forms, pull request template, funding metadata, release-note categories, canonical labels, stale automation, label sync, all-contributors metadata/workflow, and third-party notices.
- **Cloud development**: Added a Dev Container/Codespaces setup with Node.js 24 (latest LTS), pnpm, recommended VS Code extensions, and Linux packages for headless VS Code integration tests.
- **Copilot guidance**: Added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with architecture, command, test, and generated-file guidance.

### Changed

- **Node runtime floor raised to 22**: `engines.node` bumped from `>=20` to `>=22`. Supported runtimes: Node 22, 24 (LTS), and 26. esbuild `target` raised to `node22`. `@types/node` bumped to `^22`.
- **Developer toolchain pinned to Node 24 LTS**: `.nvmrc` → `lts/jod`; devcontainer base image → `typescript-node:24`. CI build matrix exercises Node 22/24/26 to validate the supported range.
- **VS Code engine floor bumped to `>=1.111.0`**: `engines.vscode` and `@types/vscode` aligned to the last 10 minor versions of VS Code (1.111–1.120). VS Code 1.110 and below are no longer supported.
- **CI/release split**: Moved tag-driven publishing from `.github/workflows/ci.yml` into `.github/workflows/release.yml`; CI now focuses on PR/main quality gates.
- **Site restructure**: Renamed Jekyll source from `site/` to `docs/`; moved packaged images from `docs/images/` to `public/images/` for cleaner extension packaging. Updated `release.yml` and `deploy-pages.yml` build paths accordingly.
- **Contributor docs**: Updated `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `SECURITY.md` for coverage, workflow ownership, Codespaces, third-party notices, and supported versions.
- **Repo name corrected**: All URLs and references updated from `additional-contexts-menu` to `additional-context-menus`.
- **Bundle size references**: Replaced specific KB figures with "optimized" across all user-facing documentation and source comments.
- **Cache TTL injectable**: `ProjectDetectionService.create()` and `FileDiscoveryService.create()` now accept an optional `cacheTTL` parameter (defaults: 10 min and 5 min respectively), enabling precise cache expiry testing without mocking.
- **Test description convention**: All test descriptions now start with `"should "`.
- **Dev dependency upgrades** (patch/minor + selected majors; TypeScript and Node `@types` held back):
  - prettier 3.8.1 → 3.8.3
  - @typescript-eslint/{eslint-plugin,parser,typescript-eslint} 8.58.0 → 8.59.3
  - @vscode/vsce 3.7.1 → 3.9.1
  - eslint-plugin-promise 7.2.1 → 7.3.0
  - mocha 11.1.0 → 11.7.5
  - tsx 4.21.0 → 4.22.1
  - ovsx 0.10.10 → 0.10.12
  - eslint 9.39.4 → 10.4.0 · @eslint/js 9.39.4 → 10.0.1 · eslint-config-prettier 9.1.2 → 10.1.8 · eslint-plugin-n 17.24.0 → 18.0.1 · eslint-plugin-security 3.0.1 → 4.0.0
  - @commitlint/{cli,config-conventional} 19.8.1 → 21.0.1
  - vitest 3.1.1 → 4.1.6 · @vitest/coverage-v8 3.1.1 → 4.1.6
- **Build tooling**: Made commit/PR size-check exclusions configurable via `scripts/commit-size-excludes.txt`, shared between the husky hook and CI workflow.
- **Error propagation**: Re-thrown errors in `ContextMenuManager` and `terminalService` now carry `{ cause: originalError }` to satisfy the ESLint 10 `preserve-caught-error` rule and improve stack trace fidelity.
- **Bundle size reduced from 7.52MB to 3.82MB**: VSIX now well below the 5MB target.
  - `codeAnalysisService` moved to `dist/lazy/` (same pattern as generator services). The TypeScript compiler (~3.4MB minified) is no longer bundled in the core `extension.js`; it loads on the first Copy/Move Function command invocation. Core bundle drops from 3.46MB to 64KB, restoring the documented ≤100KB target.
  - GIF screenshots re-encoded with ffmpeg (fps 8, 70% scale, 64-colour palette): 6.0MB → 2.9MB (~51% reduction).
  - Dev-only files excluded from VSIX: `.devcontainer/`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorignore`, `.code-review-graph`.
  - Removed broken `marketplace` block from `package.json` (referenced 5 non-existent PNG screenshots and a missing `banner.png`).
  - Codespaces SVG badge removed from `README.md` (VS Code Marketplace restricts SVG image URLs).

### Removed

- **`copyCode.handleImports` setting**: Removed the unimplemented `handleImports` configuration option (`merge` / `duplicate` / `skip`) and all its references across source, types, config validator, configuration service, `ContextMenuManager`, `package.json`, and documentation. The import merging logic was never implemented (stub with TODO).
- **Walkthrough**: Removed `WalkthroughManager.ts` and `scripts/generate-changelog.js`.

### Fixed

- **`CodeAnalysisService.extractImports`**: Fixed crash when `importClause.namedBindings` is `undefined` for default imports (e.g. `import React from 'react'`). `ts.isNamespaceImport()` was called without a null guard, causing a `TypeError`.

<summary><h2>[2.0.1]</h2></summary>

### Changed

- **GitHub Pages site (`site/`)**: Improved responsive UI/UX—fluid typography, safer grids on small screens, touch-friendly controls, sticky-header scroll padding, safe-area insets, optional `prefers-color-scheme: dark` theming, hero/media frame styling, and clearer keyboard focus. Layout fixes: invalid markup on the Features page header, accessible mobile nav (`button` + `aria-expanded`), and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on external links. Homepage **Features Documentation** section (`.services-docs` / `.service-card`) now has full card styling aligned with the rest of the site. **Features** page (`site/features.md`): fixed mismatched closing tags on the last "Cross-Platform Terminal" feature item that broke the DOM (stray `</div>` after the CTA). **Code operations** page (`site/code-operations.md`): added full styling for previously unstyled blocks (`.operation-section`, example cards, workflow steps, import/move/save panels, best-practices grid) so the long documentation page has clear hierarchy and filled bands instead of a bare container. Escaped `React.FC&lt;UserProfileProps&gt;` in the TSX sample so Jekyll/Kramdown does not treat the generics as real HTML tags (which broke the example grid and looked like empty layout); example cards are no longer scroll-animated so code blocks stay visible on load. **Documentation** Commands API section: copy tightened, per-row "Access:" boilerplate removed in favor of category hints; card grid and `<kbd>` styling (scoped under `.commands-api` so other pages' `.command-list` wrappers are unchanged).

### Added

- **🗂️ Unified Context Menu Submenu**: All commands are now grouped under a single **Additional Context Menus ▶** submenu in the right-click menu, replacing the previous scattered entries across multiple groups. The submenu appears in any file when the extension is enabled, with commands organised into four logical groups: Function Operations, Selection Operations, Workspace, and Generation.
- **🖥️ Open in Terminal in right-click menu**: `Open in Terminal` command now appears in the editor context menu (group `2_workspace@2`) in addition to its existing keyboard shortcut
- **⚙️ 6 utility commands in Command Palette**: `Show Output Channel`, `Debug Context Variables`, `Refresh Context Variables`, `Check Keybinding Conflicts`, `Enable Keybindings`, and `Disable Keybindings` are now declared in `package.json` and visible in the Command Palette
- **📦 No package.json Detection**: Informational message shown when no `package.json` is found in the workspace, explaining that Node.js project detection is required
- **🛡️ ConfigValidator**: New utility validates all string-enum configuration values on activation and logs warnings with the invalid key, received value, and fallback for any unrecognized setting
- **🔌 ICommandHandler Interface**: New `src/commands/ICommandHandler.ts` exports a formal `ICommandHandler` interface that all command handler classes now explicitly implement
- **📂 Barrel Index Files**: Added `index.ts` barrel files to `src/commands/`, `src/managers/`, `src/utils/`, and `src/types/` for clean module imports
- **⚙️ tsconfig.eslint.json**: Dedicated TypeScript config for ESLint type-aware rules, decoupling lint configuration from the production build
- **🤖 CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Runs `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` on every PR targeting `main`
- **🚀 Release Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): Automated publishing to VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX Registry on `v*` tag pushes, with VSIX verification and GitHub Pages deployment
- **🔒 Security Workflow** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`): Runs `pnpm audit`, GitHub CodeQL analysis, and dependency review on every push and weekly schedule
- **🏷️ Open VSX Badge**: README now includes an Open VSX Registry badge linking to the extension listing
- **📝 markdownDescription**: All settings in `package.json` now include `markdownDescription` fields with usage examples for the VS Code Settings UI
- **🎨 galleryBanner**: Added `galleryBanner` field to `package.json` for VS Code Marketplace branding
- **📦 ovsx Config**: Added `ovsx` configuration section to `package.json` mirroring the `vsce` section

### Changed

- **⏱️ Generate Cron Expression**: Now inserts the bare cron expression at cursor position (e.g. `0 9 * * *`) — no comment line, no quotes
- **📁 Repository structure**: Jekyll GitHub Pages site moved from `docs/` to `site/`
- **📚 Features documentation realigned**: `site/services/` now documents the 11 user-facing features (Copy Function, Copy/Move Function to File, Copy/Move Selection to File, Save All, Open in Terminal, Rename File Convention, Generate Enum, Generate Cron, Generate .env File) instead of internal infrastructure services. Infrastructure services (CodeAnalysis, FileDiscovery, Configuration, ProjectDetection, Accessibility) no longer have standalone site docs.
- **🚀 CI release pipeline**: All publish/release jobs now trigger on `v*` tag pushes (previously incorrectly conditioned on `refs/heads/main`)
- **🌿 Release builds from `main`**: `release-build` job now checks out the `main` branch (`ref: main`) to ensure releases always use the latest stable code
- **📦 Pre-release support**: Tags containing `-rc`, `-next`, `-beta`, or `-alpha` automatically publish with `--pre-release` flag to both VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX Registry
- **📄 GitHub Pages deployment**: Now depends on both `publish-vscode` and `publish-openvsx` succeeding, and is skipped entirely for pre-release tags
- **🏷️ GitHub Releases**: Pre-release tags create GitHub Releases marked as pre-release; stable tags create standard releases
- **💬 Improved Error Messages**: Function-not-found warning now lists supported function types and suggests checking cursor placement; file operation errors now include the target file path; disable confirmation now includes the re-enable command name
- **🔧 ESLint Config**: Updated `eslint.config.mjs` to use `tsconfig.eslint.json` instead of `tsconfig.json` for the `src/` configuration block
- **📚 CONTRIBUTING.md**: Restructured with a dedicated Branching Strategy section covering feature branches, Conventional Commits format, PR process, and CI workflow documentation; setup process consolidated to 5 steps with `tsconfig.eslint.json` reference
- **📖 DEVELOPER.md**: Commands table updated to note `tsconfig.eslint.json` usage in lint; project structure updated to include `tsconfig.eslint.json`; new ESLint Type-Aware Rules section added
- **📋 docs/developer-guides/adding-commands.md**: Updated to reference `ICommandHandler` interface and demonstrate barrel `index.ts` imports

### Fixed

- **🔧 CI: Missing pnpm setup in publish jobs**: Added `Install PNPM` and `Setup Node.js` steps to `publish-vscode` and `publish-openvsx` jobs — previously `pnpm dlx` would fail as pnpm was not available on the runner
- **🔧 CI: Removed unnecessary pnpm install from `setup` job**: The `setup` job only extracts version/tag from `GITHUB_REF` via a shell script; it never calls pnpm, so the `Install PNPM`, `Setup Node.js`, and `Install Dependencies` steps were redundant
- **🔧 CI: Removed `schedule` trigger**: Weekly scheduled runs were not required and have been removed from the workflow
- **🔐 Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Upgraded `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `@stylistic/eslint-plugin`, `@vscode/vsce`, `ovsx`, `lint-staged`, `mocha`, and `@vscode/test-cli` to resolve 33 high/moderate vulnerabilities in dev tooling (none affected the shipped VSIX)
- **🔄 CodeAnalysisService**: Migrated from regex-based to AST-based function detection using TypeScript Compiler API
  - Improved accuracy for nested functions (returns inner-most function)
  - Eliminated false positives in comments and strings
  - Enhanced React component and hook detection
  - Bundle size increased (TypeScript Compiler API dependency)
  - No breaking changes to public API
  - Updated 7 documentation files to reflect AST-based approach
